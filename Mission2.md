### Degen Dogs - Mission 2

Here are some high-level thoughts on my idea for Mission 2. Feedback appreciated.

Super high-level: use treasury funds to earn Degen as a form of yield, which is streamed to Dog owners over time as a form of vesting, to reduce sell pressure of the yield token.

- travel from planet Polygon to planet Degen (we are "degen" dogs, after all)
- bridge remaining treasury funds to Base or Degen chain
- swap most/all WETH to DEGEN and lock it in the Degen Staking contract
- this maximizes daily tip allowance on Farcaster
- automatically direct 100% of tips to buy tokens on MintClub (daily) (I have already coded an automation tool for this: https://warpcast.com/markcarey/0x035fb668)
- token on MintClub (degen chain) could be called BSCT or something else (mintclub tokens are bonging curve ERC20s)
- Superfluid streaming version of token (ie. BSCTx) is streamed to Dog owners via a "Distribution Pool" over a predefined period (ie. 365 days).
- one Dog equals one share in Pool
- periodically (daily? incentivized? tbd) minted tokens are added to the input stream, so the total streamed to Dog owners keeps going up.
- Dogs minted on Polygon would be claimable on the new planet, same IDs, same artwork. You keep your Dogs.
- Unclaimed treasury Dogs allocated to promotional giveaways, etc.
- Daily auctions continue on Degen Chain -- or some other distribution mechanism (ideas welcome)
- Primary UI is Farcaster frames, heavy emphasis on social to build/expand community
